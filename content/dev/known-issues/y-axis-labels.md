# Y-Axis Label Issues

Known issues and limits of the Y-Axis Labels page in Chart Internals.

## Need Verification

### Wide glyphs can be cut off in the Y column

`estimateYAxisLabelWidthPx` sizes the column at 0.58 × font size per character, but CJK and emoji
glyphs are about 1 em wide. A custom `axisValueFormatter` that prints them, such as a `万` suffix,
can get a column narrower than its labels, which are then cut off. Tick spacing also assumes a line
height of 1.2 × font size, so fonts with taller lines get less than the intended gap. No test or
screenshot shows either yet.

Options:

- Measure the longest labels with a `TextMeasurer` once per data change, as for X-axis labels.

## Confirmed

### Long labels are cut off

The Y label column is never wider than 40% of the chart width, and a longer label shows only as
much as fits on one line. Very large values in the default formatter can hit this, such as stacked
totals in the millions on a narrow chart, as can a long custom `axisValueFormatter`. The cut-off
label gives no sign that text is missing.

Confirmed by the code: `yAxisLabelColumnWidthPx` caps the column at 40% of the available width,
and `AxisYLabelsLayout` measures each label to that width on one line. Every chart uses it through
`rememberNumericYAxisLayout`.

Options:

- End cut-off labels with an ellipsis, so the missing text is visible.
- Shorten large values, such as `12.5M` for 12,500,000, before the cap is reached.

### Bar charts count the bars that fit with an estimated Y column

Bar and stacked bar charts decide how many bars fit, and so whether they scroll or compact, before
they know the plot height. They estimate the Y-axis column at the full chart height, where the tick
count can be higher than on the plot, and the column then drawn can be a character wider or
narrower than the estimate. Near the threshold, a chart can scroll when its bars would just fit, or
fit bars slightly narrower than `minBarWidth`.

Confirmed by the code: `BarChart` and `StackedBarChart` pass `constraints.maxHeight` as the plot
height to `rememberNumericYAxisLayout`, and their content builds the drawn column again from the
real plot height. Building the Y layout twice also formats every tick twice per data change, which
costs little.

Options:

- Estimate the plot height from the chart height less the X-axis row, which the outer layout can
  compute from the same label estimate.
