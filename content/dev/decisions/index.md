# Decision Log

This page records technical decisions for the project, such as changes to CI, the build, the
architecture, or the public API. Each row keeps the state before the change, the expected effect,
and, where useful, an issue to check whether it paid off. The pull request holds the details.

## Decisions

| Date | Decision | PR | Before | Effect | Revisit | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-05 | Run the Android device tests on the `aosp_atd` emulator image at 280 dpi, with drawing turned back on. | [#667](https://github.com/HDCharts/charts/pull/667) | Emulator job 13m14s–13m35s (run 37209512033). | 5m10s–6m34s over 8 runs. | — | Kept. |
| 2026-10-05 | Save the Linux and macOS Gradle caches on `main` when build files change, from a job that builds the CI targets. The iOS cache adds `~/.konan`. Other workflows on `main` restore them read-only, except release jobs (next row). The playground job keeps its own cache. | [#668](https://github.com/HDCharts/charts/pull/668), [#675](https://github.com/HDCharts/charts/pull/675) | iOS job ~14 min with no cache. 6.9 GB of macOS caches that only their own PR could read. | Expected ~10 min or less, and one shared macOS cache, for PRs that keep `main`'s build files. | [#669](https://github.com/HDCharts/charts/issues/669) | — |
| 2026-10-05 | Release jobs start with no Gradle cache, so a release builds from fresh downloads and never from a stale cache. Snapshot jobs keep using the cache. | [#668](https://github.com/HDCharts/charts/pull/668) | — | Release jobs download every dependency on each run. | — | — |
| 2026-10-06 | CI installs the JetBrains JDK 21 that `gradle/gradle-daemon-jvm.properties` names for the Gradle daemon, before JDK 17, and names its path in `org.gradle.java.installations.paths` in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`, so Gradle doesn't download it from foojay. The daemon JVM lookup ignores `~/.m2/toolchains.xml`. | [#684](https://github.com/HDCharts/charts/pull/684) | Each Gradle job downloaded the daemon JDK from `api.foojay.io`. When foojay didn't respond, every Gradle job on [#682](https://github.com/HDCharts/charts/pull/682) failed (run 37502565335). | Expected: CI no longer depends on foojay. Each job downloads JBR 21 through setup-java instead. | [#683](https://github.com/HDCharts/charts/issues/683) | — |
| 2026-10-07 | Turn off Axion's `unshallowRepoOnCI`, so only jobs that clone the full history get the real version. `Assemble`, `Compile`, `Lint` and `Test` stay shallow and build as `0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`; `Lint` moves from a full clone to a shallow one. | [#751](https://github.com/HDCharts/charts/pull/751) | On CI, Axion fetched the full history through JGit while Gradle configured every build, needed or not: about 13–24s from its `Unshallowing repo` log line to the next line in the shallow jobs. | Expected about 10–15s less per Gradle job that doesn't need the version. | [#750](https://github.com/HDCharts/charts/issues/750) | — |
